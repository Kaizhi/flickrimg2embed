Flickr Image to Web Embed
=========================

---

What?
=====
This is a handy Chrome extension that detects Flickr images (img tags) in web pages and automagically replaces them with Flickr Web Embeds.

This:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cjmartin/12180477056/" title="Deploy the DRONES! by cjmartin, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3829/12180477056_69ba0b0bc1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Deploy the DRONES!"></a>

Becomes:

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cjmartin/12180477056/frame/69ba0b0bc1" height="480" width="640"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

Why?
====
Because Flickr Web Embeds are neat, but they're iframes, and there isn't yet a nice way to use them with an image fallback for RSS feeds, etc. This plus a few other nasty differences between img and iframe mean not many people are using them yet.

This Chrome extension is a great way to see what the web would look like if every Flickr image were a Web Embed. It also gives those kids over at Flickr a great way to test the embeds and fancy new ways they might make them better.
